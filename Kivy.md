## NavigationDrawer Enhancements

I updated NavigationDrawer to support docking on Top/Bottom/Right instead of just left.  Still has some issues with right docking / main under. 
But after doing so...I realized someone had already submitted a pull request to thje NavigationDrawer repo for the same feature! 
Hmmm...I was going to submit my own, but maintainer doesn't seem very active so....whatever. It's been modded a little bit. My change examples are in
gui/navdrawer if anything ever gets overwritten.
