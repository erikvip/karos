# Raspberry PI Car PC Setup


## Interface software

Kodi - Touch input does not work very well (at all as of now...)   

A few to try:   
tpconfig qwo notes-mobile
navit navit-*  # Navigation software..

matchbox-keyboard     # On screen keyboard
matchbox-keyboard-im  
literki
dasher


ardesia # sketchpad ?

xul-ext-firegestures - execution of various commands with five types of gestures
	


## Desktops

Looking for the most touch-friendly UI...may need LXDE alternative

task-cinnamon-desktop - Cinnamon
task-desktop - Debian desktop environment
task-gnome-desktop - GNOME
task-kde-desktop - KDE
task-lxde-desktop - LXDE
task-mate-desktop - MATE
task-xfce-desktop - Xfce

kde-plasma-desktop ... 

# Window manager swithcer (?)
fusion-icon
